# League-of-Legends-Result-Analysis-2024

## Introduction
[introduction of dataset (ex: the number of rows in the dataset)]

The question that our project center around is []. The columns that are relevant to answer the question are [all column]. We chose these columns because []. When we cleaned out our dataset, we will be left with [] for future analysis. 

[Why should readers of your website care about the dataset and your question specifically?]

[descriptions of those relevant columns (in table format)]

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data

## Assessment of Missingness

## Hypothesis Testing
**Null hypothesis:** The distribution of "team_golddiffat15" for the winning team is the same as the distribution of "team_golddiffat15" for the losing team.
**Alternative hypothesis:** The distribution of "team_golddiffat15" for the winning team is different than the distribution "team_golddiffat15" for the losing team.
**Test Statistic:** We will be using []
  * We chose to use [] because [].

**Significance Level:** 5% (0.05)
  * We choose this significance level because []
**P-value:** []
  * We did [] simulations

**Conclusion:** []

~~subnote: delete after read!!
~~never use language that implies an absolute conclusion, since we are performing statistical tests and not randomized controlled trials, we cannot prove that either hypothesis is 100% true or false~
~~Justify why these choices are good choices for answering the question you are trying to answer.
